We have four types of formulation: 
* Oral Fast Disintegrating Tablet (OFDT)
* Oral Fast Disintegrating Films (OFDF)
* Sustained Release Matrix Tablets (SRMT)
* Solid Dispersion (SD)

Prediction Performance for 
* Disintegrating Time
* Release Profile
* Phsical Stability 

### Requirements 
* JDK 8
* maven 3

### Compile and Runing 
We have different four project, enter into the corresponding directory then type:
```
mvn compile
mvn exec:java
```
